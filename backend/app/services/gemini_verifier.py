"""
Property room & BHK verification, powered by Gemini 3.6 Flash.

Replaces the old two-stage local pipeline (Places365 ResNet18 for room
classification + CLIP ViT-L-14 for same-room photo deduplication) with a
single multimodal Gemini call: it looks at every uploaded photo at once,
labels each one's room type, and groups together bedroom photos that show
the same physical room from a different angle. The final claimed-vs-detected
BHK comparison still happens in plain Python, not the model, so that number
is never something the LLM could get wrong.

For EACH photo, classify which type of room it shows, using exactly one of: {room_types}.

Then, among only the photos you classified as "bedroom", group together any photos that show the SAME \
physical bedroom photographed from a different angle, distance, or lighting (e.g. same bed, same window, \
same furniture layout). Only group when you are genuinely confident it's the same physical room — two \
different bedrooms that simply share a similar style or color scheme must NOT be grouped together. A \
bedroom that appears in only one photo should not be placed in any group.

Be conservative: only report high confidence when a classification or a duplicate grouping is visually \
obvious from the photo. If you're unsure about any photo or grouping decision, say so in low_confidence_note."""
